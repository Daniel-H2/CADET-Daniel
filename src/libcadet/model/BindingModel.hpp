/**
 * @brief Defines an internal BindingModel interface
 * @details The binding model is responsible for handling bound states and their residuals.
 *          There can be multiple bound states, if the binding model supports it.
 *          Some binding models require a dedicated salt component, which is always given
 *          by component 0.
 *          
 *          The ordering inside the solid phase can be chosen by the binding model to some
 *          extent. In general, the ordering is component-major, that means, all bound
 *          phases for each component are listed one after the other. For a model having
 *          4 components with 1, 0, 3, 2 bound states, respectively, the ordering is
 *          comp0bnd0, comp2bnd0, comp2bnd1, comp2bnd2, comp3bnd0, comp3bnd1.
 *          Note that the second component is not present in the solid phase at all since
 *          it has no bound state. The bound states of the other components are ordered
 *          consecutively.
 *          
 *          Algebraic equations have to appear in an isolated block (i.e., there must not
 *          appear differential equations between two algebraic equations).
 *          
 *          It is assumed that the liquid phase concentrations are located right before the
 *          first bound state of the first component, i.e., the general layout is expected
 *          to be 
 *              comp0, comp1, ..., compN, comp0bnd0, comp0bnd1, ..., comp1bnd0, comp1bnd1, ...
 *          where comp0, comp1, etc. denote liquid phase concentrations of the respective
 *          components. Pointers to state vectors usually point to comp0bnd0 instead of comp0,
 *          but this is made clear in the documentation.
